# i3dViewer

**i3dViewer** is an interactive 3D data visualization tool built with Python. It provides a modern graphical interface for viewing, analyzing, and manipulating 3D geometries like points, polylines, and heatmaps using Qt and VTK.

**i3dViewer** is a 3D visualization and analysis application written in Python, designed with a modular architecture and UI support via Qt (likely PyQt or PySide), and visualization capabilities using VTK. This project uses Poetry for dependency management and packaging.

## âœ¨ Features

- Intuitive Qt-based GUI with multiple dialogs for interaction
- VTK-powered rendering for high-performance 3D visualization
- Modular architecture (points, polylines, heatmaps)
- Custom dialogs for model editing and user help
- Cross-platform builds supported (Linux ELF, Windows EXE)
